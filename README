Data Analysis Agent

Overview

As AI agents continue to proliferate across large enterprises, they are fundamentally transforming how workers interact with data. Agents can democratize data analysis by allowing users to query datasets conversationally and receive automated insights. This speed can provide a unique strategic advantage -- no need to wait for hours and days for insights. Decisions can be made real-time, business can respond to situations rapidly, non-technical domain experts can continue to stay focused on their domains on focus on value generation. 

Note: 
This is by no means a production ready implementation. This was a personal exercise for me to take an idea, develop a prototype, lean, and have fun along the way. 

Technical Summary
This project implements a secure, object-oriented AI agent for automated CSV data analysis using Claude AI. The system combines natural language processing with dynamic code generation and containerized execution to provide a safe, scalable data analysis platform.

Key Components:
AnalysisAgent: Core orchestration class that coordinates the analysis workflow
FileAccessTool: Handles secure file transfer from host to isolated Docker container
PythonExecTool: Executes AI-generated Python code in a hardened sandbox environment
Claude Integration: Leverages Anthropic's Claude API for intelligent code generation
Architecture Features:
Security-First Design: All code execution occurs in isolated, read-only Docker containers with no network access
Dynamic Code Generation: Claude AI generates custom Python/pandas code based on user queries and dataset structure
Object-Oriented Framework: Modular design inspired by OpenAI's agentic patterns for maintainability and extensibility
Containerized Execution: Docker-based sandbox prevents system compromise and ensures consistent execution environment

Workflow:
User provides dataset filename and natural language query
Agent securely copies CSV file to isolated container
Claude generates custom Python analysis code based on user intent
Code executes safely in hardened Docker environment
Results are returned to user with full analysis output

Security Measures:
Container isolation with dropped capabilities and read-only filesystem
No network access from execution environment
Non-root user execution
Secure file handling with validation
This implementation demonstrates how AI agents can make sophisticated data analysis accessible to non-technical users while maintaining enterprise-grade security standards.

Reference Implementation
This project draws inspiration from OpenAI's object-oriented agentic approach, particularly their secure code interpreter design patterns. The implementation focuses on production-ready code rather than conceptual demonstrations. I highly recommend AI engineers and builders to review this.
