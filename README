#**Data Analysis Agent**

##**Overview**
As AI agents continue to proliferate across large enterprises, they are fundamentally transforming how workers interact with data. Agents can democratize data analysis -- allow users to query datasets conversationally and receive automated insights. This speed can provide a unique strategic advantage -- no need to wait for hours and days for insights. Decisions can be made real-time, business can respond to situations rapidly, non-technical domain experts can continue to stay focused on their domains on focus on value generation. 

There was a time when data mining, data gathering and analytics was it's own phase of a given project that required weeks if not months and the need to specifically staff data analysts and scientists. 

Note that this capability already exists ChatGPT or Claude and enterprises that already subscribe to these can activate them. For builders, this is a nice way of getting it setup locally to give you a little bit more flexibility and integrate it into your custom workflows. Imagine being able to interact with the agent while in workshops and meetings to bring together insights that furthers the conversations to drive strategy and decision making. All this while in the room and not as an after thought. 

**Note:** 
This is by no means a production ready implementation. This was a personal exercise for me to take an idea, develop a prototype, learn, and have fun along the way. I draw inspiration from OpenAI's object-oriented agentic approach, particularly their secure code interpreter design pattern. This is a conceptual demonstration and can work for simple use cases. I welcome feedback.

##**Technical Summary**
This project implements a secure AI agent for automated CSV data analysis using Claude. The system combines natural language processing with dynamic code generation and containerized execution to provide a safe, scalable data analysis solution.

###**Key Components:**
AnalysisAgent: Core orchestration class that coordinates the analysis workflow
FileAccessTool: Handles secure file transfer from host to isolated Docker container
PythonExecTool: Executes AI-generated Python code in a hardened sandbox environment
Claude Integration: Leverages Anthropic's Claude API for intelligent code generation
Architecture Features:
Security-First Design: All code execution occurs in isolated, read-only Docker containers with no network access
Dynamic Code Generation: Claude AI generates custom Python/pandas code based on user queries and dataset structure
Object-Oriented Framework: Modular design inspired by OpenAI's agentic patterns for maintainability and extensibility
Containerized Execution: Docker-based sandbox prevents system compromise and ensures consistent execution environment

###**Workflow:**
User provides dataset filename and natural language query
Agent securely copies CSV file to isolated container
Claude generates custom Python analysis code based on user intent
Code executes safely in hardened Docker environment
Results are returned to user with full analysis output

###**Security Measures:**
Container isolation with dropped capabilities and read-only filesystem
No network access from execution environment
Non-root user execution
Secure file handling with validation
